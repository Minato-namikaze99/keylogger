# keylogger
This is a Keylogger that I made in Python using the Pynput Library

> P.S. I would recommend running this program in a Virtual Environment to avoid the issue of collision between various modules. You can take a look at [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/) article to manage Virtual Environments. 

To run this, you only need to install 1 additional module, which can be installed using the following command:

`
pip install Pynput
`


Now, run the program!

DISCLAIMER: This project is for educational and ethical testing purposes only. Using keyloggers without explicit consent is illegal and unethical. Do not use this software for malicious purposes.

> P.s. The program won't directly launch on Windows.
